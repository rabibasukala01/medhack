I understand that you're looking for solutions to reduce the symptoms of anxiety, sadness, depression, and mood swings during your period. While the effectiveness of these strategies can vary from person to person, here are some additional approaches you can consider:

1. **Hormonal Birth Control:** Some individuals find relief from PMS or PMDD symptoms by using hormonal birth control methods, such as birth control pills or hormonal IUDs. These methods can help regulate hormonal fluctuations.

2. **Dietary Changes:** Experiment with dietary changes that may alleviate symptoms. For example, some people find relief by reducing their salt intake or increasing their intake of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., fish, flaxseeds) or foods containing natural antioxidants (e.g., berries, dark leafy greens).

3. **Herbal Remedies:** Some individuals turn to herbal remedies like evening primrose oil, chasteberry (vitex), or black cohosh. However, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before trying these remedies, as they may have side effects or interact with medications.

4. **Prescription Medications:** In cases of severe PMDD, healthcare providers may prescribe medications like SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) or hormonal treatments to manage mood and physical symptoms. These should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

5. **Therapy and Counseling:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and other forms of talk therapy can help you learn coping strategies to manage mood swings and emotional symptoms effectively.

6. **Stress Reduction Techniques:** In addition to meditation and yoga, consider other stress reduction techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, biofeedback, or acupuncture.

7. **Acupuncture and Acupressure:** Some people find relief from PMS or PMDD symptoms through acupuncture or acupressure treatments. These practices are believed to help balance the body's energy.

8. **Lifestyle Adjustments:** Consider making lifestyle changes that prioritize self-care, such as setting boundaries, managing time effectively, and avoiding overcommitment during your period.

9. **Alternative Therapies:** Explore alternative therapies like aromatherapy, massage, or reflexology, which some individuals find beneficial for managing symptoms.

10. **Consult a Specialist:** If your symptoms are severely impacting your life, consider consulting a gynecologist or a mental health specialist who specializes in women's health. They can provide a tailored treatment plan.

Remember that it may take some time to find the right combination of strategies that work for you, so be patient with yourself and open to trying different approaches. It's essential to discuss any significant changes or symptoms with a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions and to ensure that the chosen treatments are safe and appropriate for you.
